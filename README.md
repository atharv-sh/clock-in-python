# Clock Project

## Overview:
This project provides two versions of a live clock. One version is implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library for GUI, and the other version is built using HTML and JavaScript for a web-based solution.

## Python Version (clock.py):
- A simple live clock built using Python and `tkinter`.
- Displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format.
- The clock updates every second and has a basic UI with a black background and cyan text.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (comes pre-installed with Python)

### To run:
1. Save the script as `clock.py`.
2. Run using the command `python clock.py`.

## HTML/JavaScript Version (clock.html):
- A web-based live clock built using HTML and JavaScript.
- Displays the current time and updates every second.
- Uses basic HTML for structure and JavaScript for real-time updates.

### Requirements:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### To run:
1. Open `clock.html` in a web browser.
2. The live clock will appear and update automatically.
